# Light Theme Implementation for Electron App

## Overview
Successfully added light theme support to the Dione electron app with a complete theme switching system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Tailwind CSS Configuration
- **File**: `tailwind.config.js`
- **Changes**: Added `darkMode: 'class'` to enable class-based dark mode switching
- **Purpose**: Allows Tailwind to generate dark: prefixed utility classes

### 2. Theme Context System
- **File**: `src/renderer/src/components/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` (NEW)
- **Features**:
  - React context for global theme state management
  - Automatic theme persistence in localStorage
  - Integration with backend config system
  - Dynamic HTML class manipulation for theme switching
  - Theme toggle functionality

### 3. App Integration
- **File**: `src/renderer/src/App.tsx`
- **Changes**: Wrapped the app with `ThemeProvider` to enable theme context throughout the application

### 4. Settings UI
- **File**: `src/renderer/src/pages/settings.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added theme selector dropdown in the Interface section
  - Updated component styles to be theme-aware with dark: prefixes
  - Integrated with useTheme hook for theme switching

### 5. Translation Support
- **File**: `src/renderer/src/translations/languages/en.ts`
- **Changes**: Added theme-related translation strings:
  - `settings.interface.theme.label`
  - `settings.interface.theme.description`
  - `settings.interface.theme.light`
  - `settings.interface.theme.dark`

### 6. CSS Styling Updates

- **Changes**:
  - Added theme-aware body styling
  - Implemented smooth transitions between themes
  - Updated scrollbar styles for both light and dark modes
  - Added proper color schemes for both themes

## Theme System Features

### Automatic Theme Detection
- Loads theme from backend config on app startup
- Falls back to localStorage if config is unavailable
- Defaults to dark theme for consistency

### Seamless Integration
- All UI components now support both light and dark themes
- Smooth transitions between theme switches
- Proper contrast ratios maintained in both modes

### User Experience
- Theme setting is accessible in Settings > Interface
- Changes are immediately applied and persisted
- Theme preference syncs with backend configuration

## Technical Implementation

### Theme Colors
- **Dark Theme**: Dark backgrounds (#080808), white text, subtle borders
- **Light Theme**: Light backgrounds (#f9fafb), dark text (#1f2937), visible borders

### CSS Classes Used
- `dark:` prefixed classes for dark mode styles
- `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#080808]` for main backgrounds
- `text-gray-700 dark:text-neutral-200` for text colors
- `border-gray-300 dark:border-white/5` for borders

### State Management
- Theme state managed through React Context
- Automatic persistence to localStorage
- Backend config synchronization
- Event-driven updates across components

## Usage

Users can now switch between light and dark themes by:
1. Opening the Settings page
2. Navigating to the Interface section
3. Using the Theme dropdown to select "Light" or "Dark"
4. Changes are applied immediately and saved automatically

## Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility with the existing dark theme while adding comprehensive light theme support. All existing functionality continues to work as expected.
